# FeNa

1-	Internal Medicine is about maintaining the function of internal organs in the body. 
2-	The kidney is one of the key internal organs. 
3-	If there is an injury to the kidney, it is crucial to know the etiology so we can treat it and predict the prognosis.  
4-	FeNa is an abbreviation for Fractional Excretion of Sodium, which is calculated to classify the kidney injuries based on etiology (pre-renal, renal, or post renal). 
5-	My project is a simplified way to mimic online calculator that can be found on this webpage: https://www.mdcalc.com/fractional-excretion-sodium-fena#evidence 

6-	Just obtain blood and urine samples. Measure sodium and creatinine levels in both serum and urine and insert the measurements into the calculator. 
7-	Pay attention to the units. 
8-	You can access the App using R by running:
